# 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world healthcare analytics database and demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze clinical outcomes, provider activity, and medication usage.

The focus is on identifying patients with uncontrolled hypertension using blood pressure (BP) vitals, analyzing treatment patterns, and exploring demographic disparities across race groups.

The dataset spans 2018–2019 and includes patient demographics, encounters, clinical events, vitals, procedures, and medications.

# 🧠 Business & Clinical Questions Answered

-How many patients had uncontrolled hypertension (≥140/90) in 2018–2019?

-Which providers treated the most hypertensive patients?

-What medications were most commonly prescribed to hypertensive patients?

-How would patient counts change using a lower BP threshold (≥135/85)?

-Which race group had:

-The highest number of hypertensive patients?

-The highest percentage of elevated BP readings?

-These questions mirror real healthcare use cases such as quality reporting, population health, and value-based care analytics.

Data quality & realistic thresholds

Analytical thinking for real-world scenarios


# ✅ Key Insights (Sample)

Multiple patients exhibited persistent uncontrolled hypertension

Certain providers managed a higher concentration of hypertensive cases

Antihypertensive medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors) were frequently administered

Lowering BP thresholds significantly increased flagged patient counts

Disparities were observed when analyzing BP metrics by race
